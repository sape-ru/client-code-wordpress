##Installation

**Important!** If you previously set the system code and folders manually, then delete them!

1. In the WordPress admin panel, go to the "Plugins" section and click "Add New".
2. In the search field, enter "sape", find our plugin and click the "Install" button. After installation, click "Activate".
3. After activating the plugin, go to its settings and enter your ID in the "User Key" field.
4. Check off the monetization formats that we will post on the site. Save the settings.
5. After setting, go to the "Outside view" -> "Widgets" section. The final step - you need to place in the right places of your topic (template) the monetization formats that you connected on the previous step. To do this, place widgets, for example, in Sidebar or Footer

### Widget setup
All settings are optional - everything will work with the default settings. Let's consider setting the widget using the example of "Sape: Rental Links" widget

- Set a title (optional)
- Set the number of links that will be displayed in the block (if left empty, all purchased links will be displayed)
- If you want to display links in block format - specify ```Format=Block``` and set how the block will be displayed: vertically or horizontally
- Click "Save" button
